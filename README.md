# Flocabulary Engineering Interviews -- Technical Challenge

As the  challenge for our interview process, we would like you to implement a URL shortener in Django, using MySQL as a database and ReactJS on the front end. 

You should host your application on Heroku, and explain some of the key decisions you faced in building the application. 

Please share the code with us in the form of a GitHub repository.
